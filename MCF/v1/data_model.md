# Data Model

## Note

I did the data model diagram in Freeform App.

There is a [read-only link to Freeform](https://www.icloud.com/freeform/0b2JuaGylFI7vRzq8O9R9f40Q#MCF_v1_Data_Model).

In case you are not able to join the board via icloud, PDF snapshot is attached in the pull request.

## Contexts and models

Trying to understand which context owns model, I think it is strange that "Tasks" context owns our client.

Maybe I missed some client registration events which could be added on the next iteration.
